<h1 id="pythonprojects---website-crawler">PythonProjects - Website Crawler</h1>
<p>This little Python project has a very specific objective. It pulls the HTML code from a webpage, then searches for specific tags and attributes, which in this case are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&quot;href&quot;</code> related to torrent links, and then list them out.
My goal from there is to download those torrent files into a folder and have <a href="https://deluge-torrent.org/">Deluge</a> pick them up for an automatic download.</p>
